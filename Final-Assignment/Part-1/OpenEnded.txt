1. We need a loop to do repeating tasks.
Example of for loop:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>JavaScript For Loop</h2>

<p id="foodie"></p>

<script>
const food = ["Nasi Lemak", "Chicken Rice", "Hamburger"];

let dishes = "";
for (let i = 0; i < food.length; i++) {
  dishes += food[i] + "<br>";
}

document.getElementById("foodie").innerHTML = dishes;
</script>

</body>
</html>

2. Console.log is a function that print what is within (). eg: let name = 'David'; 
console.log(name); It will print on the screen: David. 
Return is for returning results of a function. Eg: 
const a = 2;
const b = 5;
function add (a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

console.log(add(a, b));
The value returned is: 7.

3. Truthy values in Javascript are values that are deemed to be true in Boolean context.
falsy values in Javascript are values which are regarded as false in Boolean context.
Example of truthy and Falsy:
var isHungry = true;
var isNoon = true;

if (isNoon === true && isHungry === true) {
return `Food is serve`;}
Explanation: if it is 12noon and is Hungry(both values are true), then Food is served.

if (isHungry === false && isNoon === true) {
return `No food is served`;} 
Explanation: If not hungry and is 12noon (one is false the other is true), then no Food is served.

4. Internet is information which are shared across all the computers around the world which are
connected in a network.

5. A website works when a user typed in a request on the browser. The request would be sent to
the server asking it to send a copy of the request or website to the user browser.
The basic files that are involved are:
1) HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) Files:They are a markup language that have 
texts, links, images and other elements that makes up a webpage.
2) CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) Files: They are a language that styled a webpage. It dictataes the 
colors, fonts, sizes, margins, and other visual aspects of the webpage to give it a more presentable
look.
3) JavaScript Files: They are a programming language that makes the webpage dynamic and interactive.
They contain scripts that enable tasks such as moving images, validations, fetching data from servers
and etc.
4) Images and Multimedia Files: Images, videos, audiofiles and other multimedia elements that are in 
the websites.
